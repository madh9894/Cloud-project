# Microservices Project - EN2AR

## Introduction
This project demonstrates the implementation of a microservices-based architecture. It includes services that communicate through defined interfaces, ensuring modularity and scalability. The application is containerized using Docker for ease of deployment.

## Features
- **Microservices Architecture**: Modular and independently deployable services.
- **Docker Support**: Simplified containerization and orchestration.
- **Python-based Implementation**: Core functionality implemented in Python.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or later
- Docker and Docker Compose installed
- Basic knowledge of microservices and Docker

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd EN2AR-master
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   Install Python dependencies using `pip`:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run with Docker Compose**
   Build and start the services using Docker Compose:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

4. **Run Locally**
   Execute the main Python script:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Directory Structure

## Usage
Once the service is running, you can access the EN2AR API through the exposed endpoint. Typically, the translation service will be hosted on http://localhost:<port>/translate/en2ar, where you can send POST requests with text that needs to be translated.

For example:

POST to /translate/en2ar to submit English text for translation into Arabic.
The system will respond with the translated text in Arabic.
The system may also expose additional endpoints such as /status/{id} for checking the status of translation requests or other service-related operations.

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome! To contribute:
1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new feature branch: `git checkout -b feature-name`
3. Commit your changes: `git commit -m 'Add feature description'`
4. Push to your branch: `git push origin feature-name`
5. Submit a pull request.

## Apout
This project aims to implement an EN2AR translation microservice, built using Python and containerized with Docker. The goal is to provide an efficient and scalable way to translate English text into Arabic. The service can be integrated into larger systems requiring text translation functionality, such as a multilingual application or a content management system.
